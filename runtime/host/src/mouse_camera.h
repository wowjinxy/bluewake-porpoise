// Mouse camera (the Mac host): click the game window to hand it the mouse,
// then moving it turns the camera around Link, left and right and up and
// down, and left click is A; Esc, or leaving the window, gives the mouse back. The mouse turns the
// game's own camera (its view angles), so walls, the stick's direction and the
// camera's easing behind Link all carry on as they do.
//
// In first person (C-stick up) and when aiming an item (bow, hookshot,
// boomerang, grappling hook, telescope, Picto Box) the mouse aims instead:
// it turns Link's own aim, one to one and within the game's limits, and the
// view follows it with no lag; the stick still aims as well.
//
// The wheel zooms: in third person it brings the follow camera in or out
// (0.5x to 2x its distance, kept until changed); in the telescope and the
// Picto Box it is their own 1x-9x zoom, a step a notch.
//
// A controller's right stick (unless BLUEWAKE_STICK_CAMERA=0; on the Mac by
// default, on iOS only when asked for) turns the camera the same way wherever
// the mouse would (the follow camera): a turn rate from its tilt, no easing,
// the view held where it leaves it, instead of the game's eased C-stick camera.
// Its click is first person (and back out). In first person and when aiming an
// item it aims, as the mouse does; in the telescope and the Picto Box the left
// stick's up and down (or the D-pad's) zoom. Z-targeting and cutscenes keep the
// game's C-stick.

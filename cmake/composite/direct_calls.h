/* Direct calls between translated chunks (scripts/windows/direct_calls.py).
 *
 * A bl into another chunk ends the caller's chunk: it returns to the chassis
 * loop (dispatch_loop.h), which checks the turn, asks the host's edge service
 * about the target and dispatches it; when the callee's blr names the return
 * address, which is back in the caller's chunk, the same happens again. The
 * rewritten call does what the loop would do, without going round it: the
 * loop's own checks, then the callee's chunk through the chunk table (so an
 * enabled mod's variant is the one called), and, when control comes back to
 * the return address, the caller's block there - as the translator already
 * does for a call inside one chunk.
 *
 * The one thing the loop does that the module cannot is the edge service. The
 * service answers "nothing to do" at every address the host does not name
 * whenever its state flags are clear; the transform leaves watched calls
 * alone except the four audited dynamic equipment boundaries, whose entry
 * and return queries still consult the host. bw_direct_call_ready
 * reads the host's flags (the interrupt sources, a pending interrupt the guest
 * would take) through pointers the host hands over. Until it does, and in any
 * diagnostic mode, direct calls are off and every call goes round the loop.
 *
 * Anything else - a callee that stops for the cycle budget, an exception, a
 * return somewhere else - leaves the caller's chunk with ctx->pc where the
 * guest is, and the loop continues from there as it always did.
 *
 * No identifier here may be `ctx`: the chunks define it as a macro. */

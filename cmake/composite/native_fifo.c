/* J3D's immediate matrix loads to the GX FIFO (GZLE01 J3DFifoLoadPosMtxImm,
 * J3DFifoLoadNrmMtxImm, J3DFifoLoadNrmMtxImm3x3), native.
 *
 * Each is one block: a command byte, a length and an XF address (the matrix
 * index scaled) as halfwords, then the matrix's words copied one at a time
 * with lwz/stw from the matrix to the gather pipe at 0xCC008000 (r5 holds
 * 0xCC010000, the store offset -32768). The J3D draw code calls them for
 * every shape it draws: 0.28 percent of the game thread on Outset together,
 * most of it the per-store path of the translation (each pipe store leaves
 * the RAM fast path for gather_pipe.h's out-of-line store) and the block
 * machinery around it.
 *
 * A native call leaves what the translation leaves: r0 the last word copied,
 * r5 0xCC010000, the scaled index in r4 (the normal matrix forms' mulli), the
 * block's cycles, the last pipe store's pc and cycle suffix (each pipe store
 * leaves the RAM fast path, which stores them), pc at the return address -
 * and the gather pipe sees the same writes in the same order: through
 * bw_gather_pipe_put, store by store, when the host takes words one at a
 * time or when the batch would reach its flush point inside the function (so
 * every host call, and every read of the matrix after one, happens where the
 * translation makes it); otherwise appended to the batch at once, which is
 * the same bytes with no host call in between. Loads of the matrix are plain
 * RAM reads; stores to the pipe touch no reservation and no write journal.
 *
 * It declines, changing nothing, unless that is certain: the matrix entirely
 * in plain RAM (no mirror, no alias over MEM1), the host's pipe writer set
 * (without it a pipe store goes to the host's MMIO handler), no exception
 * pending, no write journal, the turn's budget not spent, and the next
 * deadline beyond the block (so the translation prepays it and never leaves
 * its copy for the per-instruction path). The host's GX writers change no
 * cycle state, deadline or interrupt source (runtime/host/src/main.c,
 * host_mmio_write).
 *
 * tests/native_fifo_test.c compares each against the translation, every
 * register, RAM byte and pipe write. No identifier here may be `ctx`. */

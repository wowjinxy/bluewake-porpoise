/* The actor search by name (GZLE01 strcmp, dStage_searchName, and
 * cTgIt_JudgeFilter with fopAcM_findObjectCB as its judge), native.
 *
 * fopAcM_searchFromName walks every actor, and for each one its judge,
 * fopAcM_findObjectCB, calls dStage_searchName(name) - the same name every
 * time - which strcmps it against each entry of the stage's object-name table
 * (l_objectName, 825 entries of 12 bytes at 0x80372818) until one matches. At
 * Dragon Roost Island daTag_Island_c looks up "ikada_h" (entry 383) every
 * frame: 7.4 percent of the game thread, strcmp 6.4 percent of it by its own
 * time and dStage_searchName 2.5 (2026-10-03). In the translation every one
 * of those strcmps is a call into another chunk (strcmp's, 0x8032D6E0) and a
 * return out of it.
 *
 * strcmp (the MSL's: a byte compare, then byte by byte to a word boundary
 * when both strings share their alignment, then word by word while the
 * 0xFEFEFEFF/0x80808080 test sees no zero byte in the first string, then byte
 * by byte again) runs its blocks in order on the same values: the loads, the
 * differences and record forms into CR0 (with XER's SO), the counter and
 * XER's CA where it aligns, and the cycles each block charges. It returns
 * what the translation returns - the byte difference, 0, or -1/+1 from the
 * word compare - and leaves r0, r3 to r8, CTR, CR0 and CA as the last
 * instruction to write each left it, pc at the return address.
 *
 * Its loads retain the complete observation suffix of the prepaid copies,
 * including ordinary MEM1. Anything outside MEM1 reads through get_ram_ptr
 * as mem_readN does - the guest-alias
 * registry, where the REL modules' linked data lives (0xC0400000 up: an
 * actor's own string literals, the names it searches and the archives it
 * asks for), or the uncached mirror. The native does the same, and leaves the
 * suffix of the last such load (or of the aligning block's mtctr, 2) as the
 * last suffix store. It stops at the hardware (0xC8000000 up) and at an
 * address nothing backs (a device's read handler), where the native declines.
 *
 * dStage_searchName runs its frame (the back chain, the saved LR, r29 to r31
 * through the inline register save and restore), its loop and every strcmp
 * it calls, and returns the matching entry or NULL with the registers its
 * last strcmp and its epilogue leave: r0 and LR the saved return address, r4
 * to r8, CTR and CA from the strcmps, r11 the frame's top, CR0 equal (the
 * last compare is cmpwi r3,0 on a match, cmplwi r30,825 at the end), the
 * suffix 2 (its mtlr). An entry whose first byte differs from the name's -
 * almost all of them - costs the translation 15 cycles (the call block,
 * strcmp's first two blocks, the result test and the loop step); the native
 * charges the same without the call.
 *
 * A whole search takes thousands of cycles (about 6,000 to entry 383, 12,400
 * through all 825), and the host gives the game thread windows of at most a
 * few thousand: the cycle cap, or less, the distance to the next device
 * deadline (cycle_domain.c; the DSP's step every 12,600 cycles ends most).
 * So the native runs as much of a search as the window holds, and stops where
 * the translation can take over with nothing told apart: at a strcmp's return
 * (0x80041578, the block after the call), with every register, the frame,
 * the cycles and the suffix as the translated blocks leave them there. From
 * there the chunk's own return dispatch goes on in the same chunk, and the
 * translation's checks stop the guest where they would have. Every stretch
 * the native runs between two such points (the step, the next call block and
 * strcmp, about 15 cycles for a first byte that differs) fits the window
 * whole: each block's budget check passes, each block is prepaid. The same
 * native runs from the loop's other block leaders - the call block
 * (0x8004156C), the strcmp's return, the step (0x80041588) - hooked there
 * too, so a search the translation took up again, or the scheduler resumed in
 * a later window, goes on natively from its next block. From a resumption the
 * frame is already there, and the epilogue reads it back from memory.
 *
 * Each declines, changing nothing, unless that is certain: no exception
 * pending, no aliases over MEM1, every load plain RAM or the out-of-line
 * kind above, the first stretch fitting the turn's budget, and no deadline
 * inside it (the next deadline at least 8 cycles out, beyond every block's
 * suffix, and beyond the stretch's last cycle, so the translation prepays
 * every block and never leaves its copy). dStage_searchName also needs its
 * frame's five words in plain RAM, no write journal for the entry (whose
 * prologue stores them), nothing it reads (the name, the table) under that
 * frame, the loop's counter and entry pointer its own (r31 = the table +
 * 12 * r30, r30 below 825) where it resumes, and its calls into strcmp's
 * chunk and back to pass silently, as they do in play: the module's edge
 * filter on (direct_calls.h: the host handed over its flags and the builder's
 * watch list), the host's edge service quiet, and neither strcmp's entry nor
 * the return address (0x80041578) one the host watches - then neither the
 * direct call nor the chassis loop it falls back to asks the host anything,
 * and the result is the same however each call is made.
 *
 * The judge - cTgIt_JudgeFilter's call of fopAcM_findObjectCB - is a separate
 * section at the end. The donor's unversioned batched host walk is omitted:
 * this host has its own observed actor-ID walk and no compatible name-walk
 * handshake. The certified individual entry uses the existing versioned gate.
 *
 * tests/native_search_test.c compares strcmp and dStage_searchName (from its
 * entry and from each resumption point, in windows that end anywhere in the
 * search) with the translation, every register and byte;
 * tests/native_search_judge_test.c the judge. No identifier here may be
 * `ctx`. */

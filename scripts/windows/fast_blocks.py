"""Prepaid copies of eligible translated blocks.

  fast_blocks.py COMPOSITE_SRC

Each block the translator emits starts by asking whether it can charge all its
cycles now (dolrecomp_block_can_precharge: the next deadline is further than
the block). It almost always can, but every instruction still carries the
machinery for when it cannot: its pc stored, a test of cycle_block_prepaid
that would charge it alone, the observation suffix chosen between its prepaid
value and 0. In integer code that is as many host instructions as the guest
instruction itself.

This gives each block a second copy, entered right after the block's start has
charged it all (cycle_block_prepaid true), in which
  - the per-instruction prepaid tests are gone (each is false there),
  - each suffix is its prepaid value,
  - pure instructions defer pc stores until the next observable instruction
    or exit, where the original guest pc is restored,
  - a recognized deadline refund resumes the original next instruction;
    unsupported prepaid-state changes keep their original bodies,
  - the labels are the original block's (a jump from the copy goes where the
    same jump from the block goes), and the end continues where the block ends.
Everything else is the block's own text. Only blocks that remain prepaid
throughout get copies; unsupported forms retain their original bodies.

The change is repeatable (a prepared chunk is left as it is) and keeps LF line
ends. Prepare mod variants first and run this before recording the final
generated-source digest. This generic transform accepts the ordinary pointer
state chunks; it does not require fixed-register or native replacements.
Qualification is manual until correctness and matched performance are accepted.

"""Call across translated chunks directly (cmake/composite/direct_calls.h).

  direct_calls.py COMPOSITE_SRC

A bl whose target is in another chunk is translated as "set lr and pc, leave
the chunk": the chassis loop then dispatches the target, and the callee's blr
leaves its chunk the same way to come back. Such calls and their returns are
about half of all block boundaries in play (the boundary census, over Outset).
At each one this adds a direct path: when bw_direct_call_ready says the loop
and the host's edge service would have nothing to do, the callee's chunk is
called through the chunk table, and if control comes back to the return
address with nothing to do there either, the caller carries on at its block
there. Otherwise the chunk leaves as before, with ctx->pc where the guest is.

Calls into the main executable's code are rewritten, including the REL
modules' calls to it through its 0xC0 mirror (which the dispatcher otherwise
resolves on its slow path), and calls between a REL module's chunks. None
whose target or return address the host names (runtime/host/src,
windows/src, either mirror form) is, except the four audited dynamic equipment
boundaries below: their generated direct paths query the host at both entry
and return, so the enabled native invocation still leaves for the edge service.
Calls to the register save and restore routines are already inline
(scripts/windows/inline_save_restore_gpr.py) and keep that form. Native replacements remain a separate opt-in qualification batch; this
preparation calls the selected translated chunks. BlueWake also asks the host's
versioned read-only predicate before skipping a boundary, preserving dynamic
scene/input observations and the complete particle/wake address ranges. The same test lets an instruction handed to the interpreter carry on
in its chunk instead of leaving it (transform_fallback).

The change is repeatable (a prepared chunk is left as it is) and keeps LF line
ends. When register inlining is selected, run it after inline_save_restore_gpr.py and before
scripts/mods/prepare_simulation_60hz.py, whose manifest hashes the chunks as
they finally are.
